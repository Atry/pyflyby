- Support removing imports at any level, not just top-level.
- Support adding imports inside functions.  Guess that an import should be
  local if there were any other local imports from the same module.
- Allow options in .pyflyby files such as __options__ = '--uniform'
- Allow an option in .pyflyby files that means "stop processing further
  database files"
- Pyflakes reports unused "import foo.bar" as "foo" making it hard to remove
  unused "foo.bar" (there could be other imports on the same line).
- Heuristically guess alignment style from existing code
- Grouping: Teach tidy-imports to canonicalize import groups; need the user to
  configure import groups.  Or do it the Eclipse way: for each top-level
  package, if there is more than one import statement, then make those a
  group.
- Remove pyflakes dependency - use our own AST parser
- Allow comments in a file to specify imports that shouldn't be removed,
  including "*" to mean don't-remove-any.
- Allow a comment in the file to specify alignment options.
- Guess the module name for relative imports.
- Preserve comments on import lines (as much as possible anyway - may need to
  make them standalone comments).
- Preserve line ending style (\r\n).
- If a function is defined twice, pyflakes complains about it (as expected);
  pyflyby misinterprets this as an unused import.
- Merge share/pyflyby/*.py into a single file.
- Make sure etc/pyflyby works for both systemwide installation and virtualenv
  installation
- Consider making the default database file more like a sample file that the
  user is instructed to cp to ~/.pyflyby.  What about existing users of older
  versions?  Perhaps have an auto-upgrade feature
- Refactor autoimport.py to share more with rest of pyflyby, esp AST parsing.
- Consider __mandatory_imports -= [...] instead of __forget_imports__=[...].
- Packaging:
    - Make 'install' put etc in /etc outside egg (but inside virtualenv is
      ok).  Or think about the right way to do config files otherwise.
    - Avoid compiling etc files to .pyc.
    - Make bin/tidy-imports work out of the box after sdist+unpack.  Currently
      sdist doesn't include the bin/pyflyby symlink.
    - Make zip-safe/PEP308 compliant; use pkg_resources (if possible) instead
      of __file__.
