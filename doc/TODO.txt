- Support compound statements.
- Support imports at any level, not just top-level.
- Per-directory import libraries.
- Allow configuring whether 'import's come before 'from ... import's.
- Fix bug: it currently incorrectly inserts new things inside module
  docstrings
- Pyflakes reports unused "import foo.bar" as "foo" making it hard to remove
  unused "foo.bar" (there could be other imports on the same line).
- Heuristically guess alignment style from existing code
