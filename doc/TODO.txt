- Support compound statements.
- Support imports at any level, not just top-level.
- Per-directory import libraries.
- Pyflakes reports unused "import foo.bar" as "foo" making it hard to remove
  unused "foo.bar" (there could be other imports on the same line).
- Heuristically guess alignment style from existing code
- Grouping: Teach tidy-imports to canonicalize import groups; need the user to
  configure import groups
